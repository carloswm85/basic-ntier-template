# 🛑 STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT 🛑

Use branches `main` and `developer-*` for stable and development versions respectively.

Project template generate 6 layers:

- `Data` (inner most)
- `Repository` (next)
- `Service` (next)
- `API` (next presentation layers - outer most)
- `Web.Angular` (presentation too)
- `Web.MVC` (presentation too)

## Under development

Use these branches under your own discretion:

- [developer-lightweight](https://github.com/carloswm85/basic-ntier-template/tree/developer-lightweight) - NET Core 8 without Identity API
    - It can be used, but it may require additional development to fit your needs.
    - Is has NOT been fully tested yet.
- [developer-identity](https://github.com/carloswm85/basic-ntier-template/tree/developer-identity) - NET Core 8 and Identity API
    - This one branch is more cumbersome because of the integration of Identity.
    - I would not use it yet.
