# 🛑 STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT 🛑

Use branches `main` and `developer-*` for stable and development versions respectively.

Project template generates 6 layers:

- `Data` (inner most)
- `Repository` (next)
- `Service` (next)
- `API` (next presentation layers - outer most)
- `Web.Angular` (presentation too)
- `Web.MVC` (presentation too)

## Branches Under Development

`main` brach is not reciving updates.

Remember this project is still under development. Yet, branches are usable. But because they are still under development, you shall use them under your own discretion:

- [developer-lightweight](https://github.com/carloswm85/basic-ntier-template/tree/developer-lightweight) - NET Core 8 without Identity API
    - It can be used, but it may require additional development to fit your needs.
    - Is has NOT been fully tested yet.
- [developer-identity](https://github.com/carloswm85/basic-ntier-template/tree/developer-identity) - NET Core 8 and Identity API
    - This one branch is more cumbersome because of the integration of Identity.
    - I would not use it yet.
